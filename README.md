⚠️ Note
This repository was created as part of a guided learning path ~3 years ago.
Some dependencies, CI workflows, or syntax may now be outdated and cause build/test failures.
The goal of this project was educational: to understand CosmWasm contract structure and logic fundamentals.

# Rust Crash Course

This repository contains a series of exercises and examples completed during my initial learning phase of the Rust programming language.

## 🔧 Topics Covered

- Basic Rust syntax and control flow
- Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Enums, structs, pattern matching
- Error handling and Result types
- Modularization and cargo basics

## 📚 Purpose

This project was part of my foundational training in Rust, providing me with the knowledge needed to approach smart contract development.

## 🧠 Status

Educational — not a production-ready codebase.
